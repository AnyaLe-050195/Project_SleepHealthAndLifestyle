# Project_SleepHealthAndLifestyle
1. Purpose of the project:
- The "Sleep Health and Lifestyle" project aims to shed light on the critical role of sleep in overall health and well-being. By exploring and visualizing data related to sleep habits and lifestyle factors, I want to raise awareness about the importance of prioritizing sleep for maintaining optimal health. 
- Through data exploration, my goal is to identify patterns and trends in sleep behaviors and lifestyle choices. By doing so, I aim to offer valuable insights that individuals can use to make informed decisions about their health and lifestyle.
